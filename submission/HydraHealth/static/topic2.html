            <h1>Basic dental care habits like brushing teeth </h1>
            <div id="inner-content">
                <p>Brushing your teeth twice a day is like giving your mouth a superhero shield against sugar bugs! These tiny bugs love to munch on leftover food and make your teeth unhappy. But fear not, with a toothbrush and toothpaste, you can be their ultimate hero!</p>
                <img id="img1" src="images/tooth-cleaning.png">
                <p id="p2">Imagine your brush is a spaceship zooming around your mouth, blasting away the sugar bugs with foamy, minty blasts. Brush gently in circles on all sides of each tooth, don't forget the back ones where the bugs love to hide! Spend extra time near the gums, where the shield needs to be extra strong. Two minutes of brushing is all it takes to keep your smile sparkling!
                    <br><br>
                    Remember, brushing twice a day is key: once in the morning to send the sugar bugs packing after breakfast, and again before bed to stop them from having a nighttime party. And don't forget to brush your tongue too, where some sneaky bugs might be hiding! With a little practice, brushing will become your superpower, keeping your teeth healthy and your smile bright!
                    <br><br>
                    Bonus tip: Make brushing fun! Sing a song, use a colorful timer, or choose a fun-flavored toothpaste. Brushing can be an adventure, so get creative and make it a habit you'll love!
